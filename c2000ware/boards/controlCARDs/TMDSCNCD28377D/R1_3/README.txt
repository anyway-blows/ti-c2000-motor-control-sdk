As of January 2016, all kits based on the F28377D MCU will now be replaced with the new F28379D superset device.  

These two MCU are identical except for the addition of the CLB on the F28379D MCU to enable Position Manager.  If the CLB is not a requirement in your application, that feature can be left untouched and the MCU will perform like the F28377D.
